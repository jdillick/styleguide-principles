  <h1 id="principal-1-least-specificity">Principal 1: Least Specificity</h1>
  <p><strong>Principal 1:</strong> Make any CSS selector only as specific as it <strong>must be</strong> to avoid breaking other styles, <strong>no more</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>Values:</strong> Preserves reuse of styles, and reduces the cost of style maintenance.</p>
  <h3 id="css-specificity-rules-">CSS Specificity rules:</h3>
  <p>Before we can get into the nitty-gritty of least specificity, you must first understand how the browser handles specificity.</p>
  <p>Selector types have different precedence, and all browsers use these differences to decide which style “wins” if any two selectors are setting the same property.</p>
  <p>Below we have an example of the problem the browser is solving:</p>
  <p><strong>What is the background color of the below markup?</strong>
  </p>
  <p><strong>HTML</strong>
  </p>
  <pre><code class="lang-html/xml">&lt;div class=&quot;person&quot;&gt;
    I&#39;m a person too.
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
  <p><strong>CSS</strong>
  </p>
  <pre><code class="lang-css">div.person {
    background-color: red;
}

.person {
    background-color: blue;
}

div {
    background-color: grey;
}
</code></pre>
  <p>The CSS specification was really smart in deciding how this system would work. By placing a completely different order of denomination upon different html markup characteristics that are more or less specific in the DOM, you can create a style system
    that naturally target the precise level of generic / specific that you desire.</p>
  <p>It is useful to understand the math that goes into this comparison.</p>
  <h4 id="element-selectors">Element Selectors</h4>
  <p>Elements (e.g. <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>) by themselves are the generic building blocks of markup, and their CSS selectors are the least specific. Each of these has a specificity worth
    1.</p>
  <p><strong>Count each element in the following selector and assign 1 to each.</strong>
  </p>
  <pre><code class="lang-css">div span a { /* 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 */}
</code></pre>
